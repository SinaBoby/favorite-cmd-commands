My Favorite Commands are the most handy ones for a programmer in daily life :

* `cd <filedirection>`
* `touch/mv/cp/rm <filename>`
* `git add .`
---
## `cd <file direction>`
with this command I can easily explore on my file directories . one thing is really worthy for you is time which this command helps you to save it a bit .
___
## `touch/mv/cp/rm <filename>`
these commands are also so handy and for beginning any project you need to create or move or edit some files which these commands are like magical words for you!
___
### `git add .`
while working with git,the two steps of adding to stage first and then commit the changes could be a bit boring if you need to add all modified files one by one but since you can use these short command to add all files together it could take really short time .what nice !
